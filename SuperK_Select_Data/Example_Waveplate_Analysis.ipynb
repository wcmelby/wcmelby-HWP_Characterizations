    "Let's bring in the calibration data, which was taken at 1600 nm with the sample removed from the system. First, define the reduced image folder, where all the image names should start with \"Reduced_DRRP_\". By looking at an image, manually define the center of the left and right spots as [y,x]. Manually define the \"maxradius\" of the spot so that all the light is roughly within a circle of that radius. \"cutoff\" defines a minimum flux, where if the sum of all pixels within the defined circle is less than the cutoff then the image is considered a throwaway and is automatically discarded. Throwaway images are usually caused when the camera glitches by losing track of where each pixel should go. This is a common known issue for the CRED2 (can be improved by using another cord connecting to the computer which we don't have, or by using lower fps but then the dark current gets worse). Finally, define the left flux, right flux, and rotation angles for this calibration data at 1600 nm. "
